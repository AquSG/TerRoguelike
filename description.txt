Version 1.4 out now, the Anniversary Update!

To play Multiplayer, the host must start a lobby by pressing the "Play TerRoguelike" button and selecting multiplayer, while the other players just have to join through the Terraria Multiplayer menu or Steam.

TerRoguelike is a mod that adds a completely new gamemode to Terraria, allowing you to play through a roguelike experience!
Battle through over 150 different rooms, spread across 11 different floors!
Engage in combat with 12 unique bosses, and over 60 unique enemies!
Take advantage of over 70 unique roguelike items, spread across 3 rarities, infinitely stackable, with potential synergies with eachother!

While playing TerRoguelike, you are granted 1 double jump for free, you have greater movement speed and acceleration, and you can hold down to accelerate downwards moderately faster.

To play this gamemode, simply install and enable this mod, navigate to the main menu, interact with the "Play TerRoguelike" button, and make a character. You will automatically be placed in a newly generated roguelike world. Have fun!

It is recommended that you play this gamemode with as few gameplay-altering mods as possible, as they may drastically interfere with the intended gameplay experience.

You may experience a certain error if cloud saving is enabled. Disable cloud saving if it proves to be an obstacle.

Special thanks to the Calamity Mod for their schematic system, which is used in this mod.
